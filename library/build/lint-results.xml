        id="OldTargetApi"
        severity="Warning"
        message="Not targeting the latest versions of Android; compatibility modes apply. Consider testing and updating this version. Consult the android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES javadoc for details."
        category="Correctness"
        priority="6"
        summary="Checks that the manifest specifies a targetSdkVersion that is recent"
        explanation="When your application runs on a version of Android that is more recent than your `targetSdkVersion` specifies that it has been tested with, various compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application continues to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the `targetSdkVersion` is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.

To fix this issue, set the `targetSdkVersion` to the highest available value. Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version you are adding support for: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES.html"

        explanation="Key generation, signing, encryption, and random number generation may not receive cryptographically strong values due to improper initialization of the underlying PRNG on Android 4.3 and below.

If your application relies on cryptographically secure random number generation you should apply the workaround described in https://android-developers.blogspot.com/2013/08/some-securerandom-thoughts.html .

This lint rule is mostly informational; it does not accurately detect whether cryptographically secure RNG is required, or whether the workaround has already been applied. After reading the blog entry and updating your code if necessary, you can disable this lint issue."
